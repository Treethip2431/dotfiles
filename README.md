This repositry contains my dotfiles for various applications.

Setup on a new host:

* `git clone https://github.com/willnorris/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
* `~/.dotfiles/rcm/bin/rcup`

## License

I'm not sure that many of the files here would constitute a creative work able
to be covered by copyright.  But to the extent that they are, unless otherwise
noted, they are made available under a [0BSD license](./LICENSE).

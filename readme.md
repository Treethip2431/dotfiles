# Homedir #

[Homedir][] is a project developed by Christian "[Dr. What](/docwhat)" HÃ¶ltje's
which allows controlling the contents of your home directory via a version
control system in a sane way.

[homedir][] project.  Rather than managing dotfiles in your home directory,
rootdir manages system-wide configuration files.  If you have multiple systems
that share a lot of common configuration, this may be useful.  For myself, I
simply use rootdir to maintain version history of a number of system config
files on my primary workstation.

## Dot-Files Galore ##

Within this repositry you will find all of my various dot-files for
applications like bash, vim, git, mutt, etc.  Feel free to peruse them and take
whatever is useful for you.  My bash files are most certainly the most
interesting.  I [blogged about my setup][] back in 2005, and amazingly not that
much has changed since then.  I could certainly stand to do a better job
explaining it though.
